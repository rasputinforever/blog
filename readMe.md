# Here's the Read Me!

## More to come, just wait


## Goals

1. A simple blog for myself and my opinoins

2. A toggler for various themes, so play with global themes and strict usage of classes/ids/etc

3. Using a real db, MongoDB, instead of dang JSON files!

4. Text editor that gives markdown controls on-click buttons (DIY for the purposes of learning). Text editor and preview hide the markdown as its being used... but the backend its stored as markdown for easy stringification (versus using html or something). I assume that's a big reason why markdown is nice, I'm just inuiting it here.

5. Convert images to bit to save space

6. A log-in, like a real one. Check AWS for this, I assume they have one.

7. Seems like a stretch but... commenting? Liking? We'd need to have a user database and control that. This seems frightening!

8. Launch on AWS

9. Oh yeah, and load-on-scroll (I've always had issues with this)

### Tech

* MongoDB - Free for now, wouldn't mind paying.
* React/NodeJS (basic) 
* UI Framework? Maybe we can skip this in favor of basic HTML with (as mentioned above) heavy CSS cass work and use state to adjust themes
* Express - Model - Mongo => Get re-familiar with this! (my iBookshelf app from my bootcamp is a good boilerplate)
