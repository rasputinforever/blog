# Here's the Read Me!

## More to come, just wait


## Goals

1. A simple blog for myself and my opinoins

2. A toggler for various themes, so play with global themes and strict usage of classes/ids/etc

3. Using a real db

4. Text editor that gives markdown controls on-click buttons (DIY for the purposes of learning)

5. Convert images to bit to save space

6. A log-in, like a real one. Check AWS for this, I assume they have one.

7. Seems like a stretch but... commenting? Liking? We'd need to have a user database and control that. This seems frightening!

8. Launch on AWS
